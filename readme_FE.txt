As instructed, Created an angular app which will load an csv file as input and display the result in the Screen.

App behaves dynamically, as it will output any CSV file to the screen. irrespective of no of rows and columns.

For Reading the CSV also, used only file reader concept without using any external plugins or dependencies.

All the headers and result list will work dynamically without any direct initializing in the html.

As mentioned in the instruction file, filter for the issue count is working fine.

Hopefully this app can directly fit into the production with little modification if needed.
